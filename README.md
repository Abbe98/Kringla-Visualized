# Kringla-Visualized

This project and its visualizations was created within the scope of the Swedish National Heritage Board's evaluation of generous interfaces as a complement to common web interfaces of archives and museums often dominated by text search. This prototype focuses on metadata.

## Setup

The site it self lives in the `site` directory, to view it spin up a local webserver in that folder.

The data generation scripts lives in the `scripts` directory, see separate README file for how to update the data files.
